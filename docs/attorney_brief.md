# GIS-OSS in Plain English

This is the version you can hand to a busy attorney who wants to know, in plain language, what GIS-OSS is and why anyone would spend money on it.

## One-Sentence Pitch
GIS-OSS is a privacy-first “geospatial command center” that lets Tribal governments run modern mapping, analytics, and reporting with their own data—without surrendering control to outside clouds or vendors.

## The Real-World Problem
- Tribal nations hold sensitive information: sacred sites, treaty boundaries, cultural knowledge, environmental evidence for court or agency filings.
- Most mainstream GIS + AI tools insist on hosting that data in someone else’s cloud, which is a non-starter for sovereignty, FPIC, and incident liability.
- Agencies keep asking for faster, better-documented maps, reports, and grant packets; small Tribal teams can’t keep up with the paperwork.

## What GIS-OSS Offers
1. **On-prem stack**: PostGIS, raster tools, vector tiles, and audited AI helpers that run on Tribal hardware or an air-gapped appliance.
2. **Consent + audit guardrails**: Built-in FPIC workflows, TK/BC label enforcement, elder approvals, and export redaction so counsel can prove compliance.
3. **Report accelerators**: Prompt-driven notebooks that assemble treaty-defense maps, cultural resource packets, fire plans, and grant attachments with citations.
4. **Integration bridges**: OGC services, ArcGIS/QGIS toolboxes, and offline packages so existing ESRI-heavy teams can adopt without ripping out their stack.
5. **Training & certification**: Workshops, governance playbooks, and compliance officer checklists that translate tech jargon into legal processes.

## Why Someone Pays for It
- **Lower legal exposure**: Every map/report shows who approved it, what data was touched, and how sacred locations were masked—evidence-ready if disputes arise.
- **Faster filings**: Automation shrinks the time to compile NEPA packets, grant applications, or treaty briefs from weeks to days, saving staff and consultant hours.
- **Sovereignty insurance**: TEK never leaves Tribal custody, model weights are vetted, and there are “no-train zones,” so clients aren’t gambling on Meta/AWS policy changes.
- **Audit-ready posture**: CARE principles, FPIC logs, TK/BC policies, and NAGPRA escalation steps are documented once and reused across projects.
- **Path to revenue**: The team can resell training, host secure workshops, or license managed appliances to neighboring Tribes or co-management partners.

## Typical Buyers & Scenarios
- **Tribal environmental departments**: Need defensible data for treaty enforcement, watershed protection, or grant compliance.
- **Historic preservation & cultural staff**: Require redacted views for contractors while keeping the full record in-house.
- **Legal counsel & consultants**: Want reproducible analytics they can cite in filings without touching raw TEK.
- **Co-management partners** (utilities, counties, agencies): Need to collaborate without copying sensitive datasets.

## Trust & Governance Hooks
- Consent ledger + elder approval workflows
- TK/BC label-driven access controls and export tiers
- Deterministic redaction/watermarking for sacred geometry
- Model allowlist with explicit license terms and no off-prem telemetry
- Standing advisory council + quarterly legal audits baked into the roadmap

## How to Explain the Value in a Meeting
1. **Safety first**: “This keeps sacred data inside the Tribe, with logs your office can subpoena.”
2. **Speed + funding**: “It auto-builds the maps/charts agencies demand, so we hit deadlines and unlock grants.”
3. **Evidence trail**: “Every output carries citations, consent status, and policy hash—litigation-ready.”
4. **Future-proofing**: “It plays nice with ArcGIS/QGIS but adds AI helpers and sovereignty governance the mainstream tools don’t offer.”
