# GIS-OSS Explained for Non-Tech Folks

Give this to anyone who wants a plain, high-school-level summary of what GIS-OSS does and why it matters.

## Quick Pitch
GIS-OSS is a toolkit that lets Tribal nations make maps, reports, and climate plans on their own computers so sensitive cultural data never has to leave tribal control.

## The Problem We Solve
- Tribes hold sacred locations, treaty maps, and TEK stories that can’t live on big tech clouds.
- Government agencies still expect fast, polished maps and grant paperwork.
- Most GIS/AI products assume you’ll upload everything to someone else’s server.

## What’s Inside
1. **All-local mapping tools** powered by PostGIS, raster/imagery services, and lightweight AI helpers.
2. **Consent guardrails** so elders and council members can approve or block any data use.
3. **Auto-report notebooks** that build treaty defenses, fire plans, or grant attachments with citations.
4. **Plug-ins for ArcGIS/QGIS** plus offline bundles, so current workflows keep working.
5. **Training kits** that turn the policy rules (FPIC, TK/BC labels, CARE) into checklists staff can follow.

## Why Someone Pays
- **Legal safety**: Every map and export records who approved it, what was hidden, and why—ready for audits or court.
- **Time savings**: Reports that took weeks now take days, freeing staff for field work.
- **Data sovereignty**: Nothing leaves tribal hardware, and models are on an approved list, so outside vendors can’t change the rules on you.
- **Reusable compliance**: Once the CARE/FPIC paperwork is set up, you reuse it for every project instead of starting over.
- **New services**: Tribes can host workshops, sell secure appliances, or support nearby partners.

## Who Uses It
- Environmental and cultural departments proving treaty rights or protecting habitats.
- Preservation teams that must share redacted maps with contractors without exposing everything.
- Attorneys and consultants who need solid evidence without touching raw TEK.
- Utility or agency partners who must coordinate with tribes while respecting data rules.

## Built-In Trust Features
- Consent ledger + elder approval workflow
- TK/BC label rules that control who sees what
- Automatic redaction and watermarks on sensitive areas
- Approved-model list with clear licenses and no surprise data uploads
- Advisory council + quarterly legal reviews baked into the roadmap

## How to Sell the Value in One Minute
1. **Safe** – “All sacred data stays on tribal machines, and every action is logged.”
2. **Fast** – “It spits out the maps and reports agencies demand, so deadlines stop slipping.”
3. **Proven** – “Each output carries citations and consent info, so lawyers trust it.”
4. **Future-ready** – “It works with ArcGIS/QGIS today but adds sovereignty features they don’t offer.”

That’s the whole idea—local control, faster work, and clear proof the tribe followed its own rules.
