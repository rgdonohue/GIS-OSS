# Project Status (Generated)

Source of truth for current implementation status. Generated from repository code and test files.

- Generated by: `scripts/generate_project_status.py`

## API Surface (Observed)
- `GET /health`
- `GET /ready`
- `POST /query`
- `POST /query/natural`

## Structured Spatial Operations (Observed)
- `buffer`
- `calculate_area`
- `find_intersections`
- `nearest_neighbors`
- `transform_crs`

## Current Behavior Flags (Observed)
- NL orchestration: strict parser implemented on `/query/natural` (requires embedded operation JSON); `/query` is still pending when `operation` is absent
- Authorization mode: permissive scaffold (check_permission returns True)
- Rate limiting mode: in-memory token bucket
- Query table allowlist: enabled (`ALLOWED_QUERY_TABLES` in settings)
- Audit logging: enabled (redacted DB audit writes on `/query`)

## Test Inventory (Static)
- Test files: `6`
- Test cases (`def test_*`): `35`

## Notes
- This document is generated. Do not hand-edit.
- CI validates this file stays in sync with code (`python scripts/generate_project_status.py --check`).
